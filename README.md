# OCaml 8-bit Binary Arithmetic Emulator

This project was created for the purpose of learning OCaml. It provides an implementation of 8-bit binary arithmetic operations in OCaml. It focuses on representing signed 8-bit integers as lists of bits (0s and 1s) and performing arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction on these representations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have OCaml and Dune installed on your system. 

* Download OCaml and find installation instructions at [https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml](https://ocaml.org/docs/installing-ocaml).
* Install Dune build system with the OCaml Package Manager using `opam install dune`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/derekjtong/emulator`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd emulator`

3. Run the program

`dune exec emulator`
