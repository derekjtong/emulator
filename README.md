# OCaml 8-bit Binary Arithmetic Emulator

This project was created for the purpose of learning OCaml. It provides an implementation of 8-bit binary arithmetic operations in OCaml. It focuses on representing signed 8-bit integers as lists of bits (0s and 1s) and performing arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction on these representations.
